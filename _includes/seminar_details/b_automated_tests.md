The seminar can cover:

 * What tests are.
 * Why tests are valuable.
 * How to write tests (including when it is tricky).
 * When to write tests.
 * Running tests.

Software & Technologies Used:

 * [Python](https://www.python.org/){:target="_blank"} - a popular programming language.
 * [Python unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html){:target="_blank"} - the built-in unit testing framework in Python.
 * [Python unittest.mock](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html){:target="_blank"} - the built-in mocking framework in Python.

After this seminar, developers will be able to:

 * Write automatically runnable tests for new and existing code.
 * Use mocking frameworks to test code without interacting with production systems.
 * Use tests to accelerate their own development practises.

This seminar can be tweaked to use the languages and libraries of your choice. It can cover writing tests for code that resembles the kind of code you write to make the examples more relevant.

Please [get in touch with me](mailto:hi@tkiley.co.uk) and we can customise this seminar to match your skills and desired technologies.
