* Resolving conflicting changes from multiple developers.
* How to use the "Github workflow" to enhance collaboration.

Software & Technologies Used:
 * [Git](https://git-scm.com/){:target="_blank"} - the industry standard source control solution.
 * [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/){:target="_blank"} - a widely used cloud tool for storing source code and more.
 * [Git-Cola](https://git-cola.github.io/){:target="_blank"} - a user friendly tool for interacting with Git.

After this seminar, the developers will be able to:

* Use source control to store and update their source code.
* Resolve issues arising from multiple developers editing the same set of files.
* Prototype new ideas without risking existing solutions.

This seminar can be tweaked to use different source control software and hosting options to match your existing workflows.
