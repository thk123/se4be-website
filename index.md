# Software Engineering Best Practices for Busy Experts

{% include opening_box.html content="I offer a course designed to help scientists, engineers and other domain experts to learn the most important software engineering best practices to help them write correct code more efficiently." %}

**[Get in touch](mailto:hi@tkiley.co.uk) today to learn how to use software industries best practices in your work.**

Writing code is now an _essential part of all science and technology_ research and development - yet many of the scientists and domain experts have _never received training on software engineering_ best practices, and are instead expected to figure it out. The result of this is slow software development and unreliable software.

[Get in touch](mailto:hi@tkiley.co.uk) today to learn the skills needed for _effective software development_.

### Seminar A: Source Control

Source control is a tool that facilitates collaboration between multiple developers working on the same code, as well as ensuring reproducible results.

**Source control is indispensable for working with other developers on code.**

I will cover setting up source control for your project, before going onto best practices for using them successfully.

[Get in touch](mailto:hi@tkiley.co.uk) today to learn how to use source control effectively.

#### Seminar Syllabus

The seminar can cover:

* Why you should use source control.
* How to setup source control with your project.
* How to perform fundamental source control operations.
* Resolving conflicts between multiple developers changes.
* How to use the "Github workflow" to enhance collaboration.

Software & Technologies Used:
 * [Git](https://git-scm.com/){:target="_blank"} - the industry standard source control solution.
 * [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/){:target="_blank"} - a widely used cloud tool for storing source code and more.
 * [Git-Cola](https://git-cola.github.io/){:target="_blank"} - a user friendly tool for interacting with Git.
 * [Kdiff3](https://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/){:target="_blank"} - a user friendly tool for resolving merge conflicts.

This seminar can be tweaked to use different source control software and hosting options to match your existing workflows. Please get in touch with me and we can customise this talk to meet your needs and match your skills.

### Seminar B: Automated Tests

Learning to write automated tests will free the domain experts from having to constantly test changes by hand. Instead tests automatically check the code does what the developer intends.

**Writing automated tests will eliminate new bugs and speed up collaboration.**

Automated tests are one of the most powerful tools in a developers toolkit. My motto forged from years of practical experience is _code that isn't tested does not work as expected_.

This seminar will explain all the ways in which automated tests are essential. It will cover how to write tests, even when the code is complicated, with plenty of examples.

#### Seminar Syllabus

The seminar can cover:

 * What tests are.
 * Why tests are valuable.
 * How to write tests (including when it is tricky).
 * When to write tests.
 * Running tests.

Software & Technologies Used:

 * [Python](https://www.python.org/){:target="_blank"} - a popular programming language.
 * [Python unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html){:target="_blank"} - the built-in unit testing framework in Python.
 * [Python unittest.mock](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html){:target="_blank"} - the built-in mocking framework in Python.

This seminar can be tweaked to use the language of your choice, or cover testing examples that resemble the kind of code you write to make this easier to apply. [Get in touch](mailto:hi@tkiley.co.uk) today to start writing automated tests today.

### Seminar C: "Good" Code

Writing "good" code is elusive, even for experienced developers. By following industry approaches you can start writing better code now, and over time your code will become more readable, testable and maintainable.

**Code is a communication tool, writing good code will minimize misunderstanding between past and future developers.**

My experience has taught me that good code is code that is:

1. Readable
2. Testable
3. Maintainable

This seminar will justify why writing good code is important, before providing a _large toolkit of guidelines and techniques_ that can be applied to your code to make it more readable, testable and maintainable.

I can review your existing code to focus on the techniques that will help you fix the kind of problems that you're experiencing in your code base.

[Get in touch](mailto:hi@tkiley.co.uk) today to start learning how to write better code.

#### Seminar Syllabus

The seminar can cover:

 * A working definition of good code.
 * How to make code readable.
 * How to make code testable.
 * How to make code maintainable.

 Software & Technologies Used:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/){:target="_blank"} - a popular programming language.

### Seminar D: Code Review

A code review process spots defects and share knowledge amongst developers. It involves having one developer review another developers changes to the source code before it is submitted.

**Having a code review process will simultaneously upskill your developers and improve the quality of your code.**

Code review _ensures that the code is understood by everyone_, as well as sharing coding best practices organically.

This seminar will cover all the advantages of a code review process. It will explain how to implement one, and then how to make the most of it.

[Get in touch](mailto:hi@tkiley.co.uk) today to learn about how code review can help your software development practices. This seminar can be customised to include reviewing someones code as part of a demonstration.

#### Seminar Syllabus

The seminar can cover:

 * What a code review process is.
 * What to look for in a code review.
 * How to make your code easy to review.

Software & Technologies Used:

 * [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/){:target="_blank"} - a widely used cloud tool for conducting code reviews.

As with all the other seminars, get in touch if you want to use a different platform for conducting code reviews and I can tailor the course to match that to make it easier to apply this to your existing workflows.

### Seminar E: Continuous Integration

Continuous Integration (CI) is an industry standard approach to catche problems before they affect other developers and customers. It achievs this by automatically checking all changes to projects.

**Continuous Integration allows developers to make changes confidently and efficiently.**

Using CI is a cheap and easy way to increase the reliability of your software. Every change to the code is checked automatically, freeing experts up from testing changes by hand and to focus on their expertise. It helps developers work together, without breaking each others work.

This seminar will cover setting up a basic continuous integration system, and go into details of what a good CI system should do.

#### Seminar Syllabus

The seminar can cover:

 * What CI is and does.
 * How to set up a basic CI.
 * How to use a CI system.
 * Maximizing the value of a CI system.

Software & Technologies Used:

 * [Gitlab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/){:target="_blank"} - a popular cloud platform for running a CI system on.
 * [Python unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html){:target="_blank"} - the built-in unit testing framework in Python.

This seminar can be adjusted to use examples from your preferred technologies. After the course I'd be happy to help with troubleshooting any problems that arise.
