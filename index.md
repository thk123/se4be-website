# Software Engineering Best Practises for Busy Experts

{% include opening_box.html content="I offer a series of seminars designed to help scientists, engineers and other domain experts to learn the most important software engineering best practises to help them write correct code more efficently." %}

**If your company has domain experts who are writing code, [get in touch](mailto:hi@tkiley.co.uk) today to increase both the reliability of the software you produce, as well as the speed at which you can develop it.**

I have been writing code for ten years in a range of industries including science, technology, games and healthcare. In this time I have learnt the importance of good software practises like writing automated tests to check the code is correct and using continuous integration.

Writing code is now an essential part of all science and technology research and development - yet many of the scientists and domain experts have never received training on software engineering best practices, and are instead expected to figure it out. The result of this is, at best, slow software development, and at worst incorrect research results.

Through the techniques covered in these seminars, not only will the code produced be more reliable, but development will actually be easier and faster for the experts.

**Get a tailored seminar series that will meet the specific needs of your company.**

The seminars themselves can be tailored to the specific needs of your company. I am also available following the talks to have group or one-on-one meetings to discuss the specific software engineering challenges you face, and work with you to come up with a solution that works for everyone.

You can read more about what the course covers and how it is structured [here](#the-course).

## The Course

The course is designed to cover the key areas of modern software engineering best practises. Each module will help developers to adopt industry standard approaches to developing software. These cover both technical topics such as writing automated tests, as well as procedural topics such as en effective code review process.

You may already be using some of these techniques, so the course is entirely customsisable to exclude the parts you already do, or provide more details on what is mission critical to you.

**Get in touch today to craft a bespoke course for your business.**

The full course consists of 5 modules:

 1. [Source Control](#source-control)
 2. [Automated Tests](#automated-tests)
 3. [“Good” Code](#good-code)
 4. [Code Review](#code-review)
 5. [Continuous Integration (CI)](#continuous-integration-ci)

 Each of the talks features practical examples using Python, [Git](https://git-scm.com/), Gitlab. After each talk I will answer questions - giving plenty of time for the specific challenges you are having using these best practises. I also like to foster an on-going relationship after the talks to help you put these tools and techniques into practise.

### Souce Control

Source control is a tool that stores your source code, and tracks changes to that code across time. Popular source control software includes [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/).

If you are not already using source control, this module will teach you how to use Git - the most popular source control amongst professional developers to manage changes to your source control, including using task branches (the "Github flow" workflow) and resolving merge conflicts.

**Source control is vital for working with other developers on code. It allows for fast iteration, whilst maintaining stability of the software. Learning to use source control will revolutionise your software development process.**

If you already use source control, well done! This module can be tailored to whatever tools you use and to cover best practises for using them effectivey. Get in touch today to discuss how to make this module be useful for your company.

### Automated Tests

Automated tests are one of the most powerful tools in a developers toolkit. By writing little bits of code that test specific portions of your piece of software, you free yourself up from having to constantly re-test your changes by hand. It also improves the overall reliability of the software when you have multiple people working on the same project.

This module will explain all the ways in which automated tests are indispensible. It will cover how to write tests, even when the code is complicated, with plenty of Python examples.

**In my experience I have seen that code that isn't tested does not work as the writer intends. Learning to write tests will help your software developement process be more correct in the long term, and faster in the short term.**

This module can be tweaked to use the language of your choice, or cover testing examples that resemble the kind of code you write to make this easier to apply. Get in touch today to start writing automated tests today.

### "Good" Code

Writing code is relatively easy, but writing "good" code is elusive. My experience has taught me that good code is code that is:

1. Readable
2. Testable
3. Maintainable

This module will justify why writing good code is important, before providing a large toolkit of guidelines and techniques that can be applied to your code to make it more readable, testable and maintainable.

**Code is a communication tool, writing good code will minimize misunderstanding between past and future developers.**

This module can be adjusted by reviewing some of your existing code to see the kind of problems that your experiencing and focusing on the techniques that will apply to your code base. Get in touch today to start learning how to write better code.

### Code Review

A code review process involves having one developer review another developers changes to the source code before it is submitted. It is a key step to ensuring that code is readable and tested. It also serves to reduce the "bus factor" of the project. It also upskills developers on code writing techniques for free.

This module will cover all the advantages of a code review process. It will explain how to practically implement one, using Gitlabs code review tools. Finally it will cover how to review code efficently, maximising the benifit for the time spent.

**Having a code review process will simulatenously upskill your developers and improve the quality of your code.**

Get in touch today to learn about how code review can help your software development practises. This module can be customised to include reviewing someones code as part of a demonstration.

### Continuous Integration (CI)

Using Continuous Integration technologies like Gitlab Actions or CircleCI is a very cheap and easy way to increase the reliability of your software. In conjunction with source control and automated tests, every change to the code is checked to actually do what it is supposed to do. This frees developers up from testing changes by hand and to focus on their important work.

This module will cover setting up a basic continuious integration system using Gitlab Actions. It will also cover what a good CI should be doing.

**Continuous Integration allows developers to make changes confidently and efficently.**

This module can be adjusted to use examples from your preferred technologies. After the course I'd be happy to help with troubleshooting any problems that arise.


## Pricing

Each of the modules cost £1200 to deliver. An on-going consulting after the talks is £600 per day, or £100 per hour.

I am deeply passionate about helping domain experts become better software engineers. If this pricing structure doesn't work for you, or you want to tailor the course to your business needs then please get in touch and we can discuss a pricing structure that works for you.
