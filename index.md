# Software Engineering Best Practices for Busy Experts

{% include opening_box.html content="I offer a course designed to help scientists, engineers and other domain experts to learn the most important software engineering best practices to help them write correct code more efficiently." %}

**[Get in touch](mailto:hi@tkiley.co.uk) today to learn how to use software industries best practices in your work.**

Writing code is now an _essential part of all science and technology_ research and development - yet many of the scientists and domain experts have _never received training on software engineering_ best practices, and are instead expected to figure it out. The result of this is slow software development and unreliable software.

### Seminar A: Source Control

Source control is essential tool for any project with multiple developers. This seminar will teach you how to use it to improve collaboration.

**Source control is indispensable for working with other developers on code.**

Source control allows developers to iterate with confidence, share works-in-progress with others and see what changes introduced problems. No software project should be undertaken without it.

I will cover setting up source control for your project, before going onto best practices for using them successfully.

[Get in touch](mailto:hi@tkiley.co.uk) today to learn how to use source control effectively.

{% details Seminar Syllabus %}

The seminar can cover:

* Why you should use source control.
* How to setup source control with your project.
* How to perform basic source control operations.
* Resolving conflicting changes from multiple developers.
* How to use the "Github workflow" to enhance collaboration.

Software & Technologies Used:
 * [Git](https://git-scm.com/){:target="_blank"} - the industry standard source control solution.
 * [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/){:target="_blank"} - a widely used cloud tool for storing source code and more.
 * [Git-Cola](https://git-cola.github.io/){:target="_blank"} - a user friendly tool for interacting with Git.

### Seminar B: Automated Tests

Automated tests are a way to automatically improve the stability and accuracy of your software. This seminar will explain how to create tests, freeing developers up from manual testing to focus on their expertise.

**Writing automated tests will eliminate new bugs and speed up collaboration.**

Automated tests will speed up development, as domain experts won't have to constantly test their changes by hand. My motto forged from years of practical experience is _code that isn't tested, does not work_.

This seminar will explain all the ways in which automated tests are useful. It will cover how to write tests, even when the code is complicated, with plenty of examples.

[Get in touch](mailto:hi@tkiley.co.uk) today to start writing automated tests today.

{% details Seminar Syllabus %}

The seminar can cover:

 * What tests are.
 * Why tests are valuable.
 * How to write tests (including when it is tricky).
 * When to write tests.
 * Running tests.

Software & Technologies Used:

 * [Python](https://www.python.org/){:target="_blank"} - a popular programming language.

 * [Python unittest.mock](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html){:target="_blank"} - the built-in mocking framework in Python.

This seminar can be tweaked to use the language of your choice, or cover testing examples that resemble the kind of code you write to make this easier to apply. Please [get in touch with me](mailto:hi@tkiley.co.uk) and we can customise this seminar to match your skills and desired technologies.

{% enddetails %}

### Seminar C: "Good" Code

Writing "good" code is necessary to ensure software can be efficiently developed over time. This seminar will give developers a large toolkit of techniques that will make your code more readable, testable and maintainable.

**Good code allows future developers to understand and therefore improve software.**

By applying some simple techniques you can ensure the code you write is _readable, testable and maintainable_. Code that has these properties will be more correct and easier for developers to work on.

{% enddetails %}

### Seminar D: Code Review

A code review process improves code quality and shares knowledge amongst developers. This seminar will teach developers a system for efficiently reviewing code, focusing on what is important to improve.

**A code review process will upskill your developers and improve the quality of your code.**

Code review _ensures that the code is understood by everyone_. This is necessary to ensure projects can be developed over a longer time frame as teams change. It also facilitates _organic sharing of coding best practices_ - ensuring new developers learn quickly.

This seminar will cover all the advantages of a code review process. It will explain how to implement one, and then how to make the most of it.

{% enddetails %}

### Seminar E: Continuous Integration

Continuous Integration (CI) is an industry standard approach to catches problems before they affect other developers and customers. This seminar will show developers how to set a CI up immediately, and how to make it as useful as possible.

**Continuous Integration allows developers to make changes confidently and efficiently.**

Using CI is a cheap and easy way to _increase the reliability of your software_. Every change to the code is checked automatically, freeing experts up from testing changes by hand and to focus on their expertise. It helps developers work together, without breaking each others work.
