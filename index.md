# Software Engineering Best Practices for Busy Experts

{% include opening_box.html content="I offer a course designed to help scientists, engineers and other domain experts to learn the most important software engineering best practices to help them write correct code more efficiently." %}

**[Get in touch](mailto:hi@tkiley.co.uk) today to learn how to use software industries best practices at your work.**

Writing code is now an _essential part of all science and technology_ research and development - yet many of the scientists and domain experts have _never received training on software engineering_ best practices, and are instead expected to figure it out. The result of this is slow software development and unreliable software.

I can deliver a course that will teach your developers the _industry standard techniques_ to write more reliable code faster.

Email me at [hi@tkiley.co.uk](mailto:hi@tkiley.co.uk) to discuss how this course can help your company develop software effectively.

## The Course

The course is designed to cover the key areas of modern software engineering best practices. Each seminar will help developers to adopt _industry standard approaches_ to developing software.

The course consists of 5 seminars:

 1. [Source Control](#source-control)
 2. [Automated Tests](#automated-tests)
 3. [“Good” Code](#good-code)
 4. [Code Review](#code-review)
 5. [Continuous Integration](#continuous-integration)

## About Thomas

I have been writing code for ten years in a range of industries including science, technology, games and healthcare. In this time I have learnt _the importance of good software practices_ in writing correct code quickly, and in collaboration with others.

In my time as team lead I was able to see how good software practices can _speed up delivery_ and increased quality.

I am really motivated to use my experience of software engineering experts fulfil their technologies potential. Please [get in touch](mailto:hi@tkiley.co.uk) to unlock your expertise.

## Course Syllabus

The course consists of 5 seminars:

 1. [Source Control](#source-control)
 2. [Automated Tests](#automated-tests)
 3. [“Good” Code](#good-code)
 4. [Code Review](#code-review)
 5. [Continuous Integration](#continuous-integration)

Each of the seminars features _practical examples_ to see how these techniques can be applied. These seminars take the form of a 45 minute presentation and time for questions. This interactivity ensures the techniques can be applied in your domain.

The seminars can be delivered in person at your office, via a video call or a hybrid approach.

In addition to the off-the-shelf course, I am happy to tailor the course to _match your needs, experience and technologies_.

**[Get in touch](mailto:hi@tkiley.co.uk) today to craft a bespoke course for your business.**

I also like to foster an on-going relationship after you have completed the course to _help you put these tools and techniques into practice_.

[Get in touch](mailto:hi@tkiley.co.uk) today to learn the skills needed for _effective software development_.

### Seminar A: Source Control

Source control is a tool that stores your source code, and tracks changes made to it across time. It facilitates collaboration between multiple developers working on the same code, as well as ensuring reproducible results.

**Source control is indispensable for working with other developers on code.**

If you already use source control then this seminar can be tailored to whatever tools you are already using. I will cover best practices for using them successfully.

[Get in touch](mailto:hi@tkiley.co.uk) today to learn how to use source control effectively.

#### Topics & Technologies

The off-the-shelf seminar will cover:

* Why you should use source control
* How to setup a new [Git](https://git-scm.com/) repository (Git is the most popular source control software in industry).
* How to host your new repository on [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) - a widely used cloud tool for storing source code and more
* Basic operations of git, using the command line and [Git-Cola](https://git-cola.github.io/) - a user friendly tool for interacting with Git
* Resolving merge conflicts using [Kdiff3](https://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/) when multiple people have edited the same file
* How to use the "Github workflow" to enhance collaboration

This seminar can be tweaked to use different source control software, hosting options to match your existing workflows.  Please get in touch with me and we can customise this talk to meet your needs and match your skills.

### Seminar B: Automated Tests

Automated tests are one of the most powerful tools in a developers toolkit. My motto forged from years of practical experience is _code that isn't tested does not work_ as expected.

Learning to write automated tests will free the domain experts from having to constantly re-test changes by hand. It will also improve the overall reliability of the software, particularly when you have multiple people working on the same project.

**Learn to write tests to eliminate new bugs and speed up development in the process.**

This seminar will explain all the ways in which automated tests are essential. It will cover how to write tests, even when the code is complicated, with plenty of examples.

#### Technologies

The off-the-shelf seminar will use:

 * [Python](https://www.python.org/) - a popular programming language
 * [Python unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) - the built-in unit testing framework in Python
 * [Python unittest.mock](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html) - the built-in mocking framework in Python

This seminar can be tweaked to use the language of your choice, or cover testing examples that resemble the kind of code you write to make this easier to apply. [Get in touch](mailto:hi@tkiley.co.uk) today to start writing automated tests today.

### Seminar C: "Good" Code

Writing code is relatively easy, but writing "good" code is elusive. My experience has taught me that good code is code that is:

1. Readable
2. Testable
3. Maintainable

This seminar will justify why writing good code is important, before providing a _large toolkit of guidelines and techniques_ that can be applied to your code to make it more readable, testable and maintainable.

**Code is a communication tool, writing good code will minimize misunderstanding between past and future developers.**

This seminar can be adjusted by reviewing some of your existing code to see the kind of problems that your experiencing and focusing on the techniques that will apply to your code base. [Get in touch](mailto:hi@tkiley.co.uk) today to start learning how to write better code.

### Seminar D: Code Review

A code review process involves having one developer review another developers changes to the source code before it is submitted. It is a key step to _ensuring that code understood by everyone_, as well as sharing coding best practices organically.

This seminar will cover all the advantages of a code review process. It will explain how to implement one, and then how to make the most of it.

**Having a code review process will simultaneously upskill your developers and improve the quality of your code.**

[Get in touch](mailto:hi@tkiley.co.uk) today to learn about how code review can help your software development practices. This seminar can be customised to include reviewing someones code as part of a demonstration.

#### Technologies

* [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) - a widely used cloud tool for conducting code reviews

As with all the other seminars, get in touch if you use a different platform for conducting code reviews and I can tailor the course to use that website to make it easier to apply this to your existing workflows.

### Seminar E: Continuous Integration (CI)

Using Continuous Integration (CI) technologies is a cheap and easy way to increase the reliability of your software. Every change to the code is checked automatically, freeing experts up from testing changes by hand and to focus on their expertise. It helps developers work together, without breaking each others work.

**Continuous Integration allows developers to make changes confidently and efficiently.**

This seminar will cover setting up a basic continuous integration system, and go into details of what a good CI system should do.

#### Technologies

 * [Gitlab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) - a popular cloud platform for running a CI system on

This seminar can be adjusted to use examples from your preferred technologies. After the course I'd be happy to help with troubleshooting any problems that arise.
