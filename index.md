# Software Engineering Best Practices for Busy Experts

{% include opening_box.html content="I offer a course designed to help scientists, engineers and other domain experts to learn the most important software engineering best practices to help them write correct code more efficiently." %}

**[Get in touch](mailto:hi@tkiley.co.uk) today to learn how to use software industry best practices to make optimal use of your expertise.**

Writing code is now an _essential part of all science and technology_ research and development - yet many of the scientists and domain experts have _never received training on software engineering_ best practices, and are instead expected to figure it out. The result of this is slow software development and unreliable software.

I can deliver a course and on-going support that will teach your developers the _industry standard techniques_ to write more reliable code faster.

Email me at [hi@tkiley.co.uk](mailto:hi@tkiley.co.uk) to discuss how this course can help your company develop software effectively.

## About Thomas

I have been writing code for ten years in a range of industries including science, technology, games and healthcare. In this time I have learnt how good software practices speed up delivery and increase code quality.

I am really motivated to use my experience of software engineering to help experts fulfil their technologies potential.

Please [get in touch](mailto:hi@tkiley.co.uk) to see how I can help make the most of your expertise.

## Course Syllabus

The course consists of 5 seminars:

 1. [Source Control](#seminar-a-source-control)
 2. [Automated Tests](#seminar-b-automated-tests)
 3. [“Good” Code](#seminar-c-good-code)
 4. [Code Review](#seminar-d-code-review)
 5. [Continuous Integration](#seminar-e-continuous-integration)

These seminars take the form of a 45 minute presentation plus plenty of time for questions. Each of the seminars will feature plenty of _practical examples_ to see how these techniques can be applied.

The seminars can be delivered in person at your office, via a video call or a hybrid approach.

I am happy to tailor the course to _match your needs, experience and technologies_.

**[Get in touch](mailto:hi@tkiley.co.uk) today to craft a bespoke course for your business.**

I want to foster an on-going relationship after you have completed the course to _help you put these tools and techniques into practice_.

[Get in touch](mailto:hi@tkiley.co.uk) today to learn the skills needed for _effective software development_.

### Seminar A: Source Control

Source control is essential tool for any project with multiple developers. This seminar will teach you how to use source control to improve collaboration.

**Source control is indispensable for any project with multiple developers.**

Source control allows developers to iterate with confidence, share works-in-progress with others and see what changes introduced problems. _No software project should be undertaken without it._

I will cover setting up source control for your project, before going onto best practices for using them successfully.

[Get in touch](mailto:hi@tkiley.co.uk) today to learn how to use source control effectively.

### Seminar B: Automated Tests

Automated tests are a way to automatically improve the stability and accuracy of your software. This seminar will explain how to create tests, freeing developers up from manual testing to focus on their expertise.

**Writing automated tests will eliminate new bugs and speed up collaboration.**

Automated tests will speed up development, as domain experts won't have to constantly test their changes by hand. My motto forged from years of practical experience is _code that isn't tested, does not work_.

This seminar will convince developers of the value of automated tests. It will cover how to write tests, even for complicated code. There will be plenty of examples to help developers understand.

[Get in touch](mailto:hi@tkiley.co.uk) today to start writing automated tests.

### Seminar C: "Good" Code

Writing good code is necessary to ensure software can be efficiently developed over time. This seminar will give developers a large toolkit of techniques that will make your code more readable, testable and maintainable - the qualities of good code.

**Good code allows future developers to understand and therefore improve software.**

By applying some simple techniques you can ensure the code you write is _readable, testable and maintainable_. Code that has these properties will be more correct and easier for developers to work on.

### Seminar D: Code Review

A code review process improves code quality and shares knowledge amongst developers. This seminar will teach developers a system for efficiently reviewing code, focusing on what is important to improve.

**A code review process will upskill your developers and improve the quality of your code.**

Code review _ensures that the code is understood by everyone_. This is necessary to ensure projects can be developed over a longer time frame as teams change. It also facilitates _organic sharing of coding best practices_ - ensuring new developers learn quickly on the job.

This seminar will cover all the advantages of a code review process. It will explain how to implement one, and then how to make the most of it.

[Get in touch](mailto:hi@tkiley.co.uk) today to learn about how review code effectively.

{% include syllabus_section.html content="d_code_review.md" %}

### Seminar E: Continuous Integration

Continuous Integration (CI) is an industry standard approach to catch problems before they affect other developers and customers. This seminar will show developers how to set up a CI, and how to make it as useful as possible.

**Continuous Integration allows developers to make changes confidently and efficiently.**

Using CI is a cheap and easy way to _increase the reliability of your software_. Every change to the code is checked automatically, freeing experts up from testing changes by hand and to focus on their expertise. It helps developers work together, without breaking each others work.

This seminar will cover setting up a basic CI, and go into details of what a good CI system should do.

[Get in touch](mailto:hi@tkiley.co.uk) today to learn how to get your CI up and running.
