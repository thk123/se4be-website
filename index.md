# Software Engineering Best Practices for Busy Experts

{% include opening_box.html content="I offer a series of seminars designed to help scientists, engineers and other domain experts to learn the most important software engineering best practices to help them write correct code more efficiently." %}

**If your company has domain experts who are writing code, [get in touch](mailto:hi@tkiley.co.uk) today to increase both the reliability of the software you produce, as well as the speed at which you can develop it.**

I have been writing code for ten years in a range of industries including science, technology, games and healthcare. In this time I have learnt the importance of good software practises like writing automated tests to check the code is correct and using continuous integration.

Writing code is now an essential part of all science and technology research and development - yet many of the scientists and domain experts have never received training on software engineering best practices, and are instead expected to figure it out. The result of this is, at best, slow software development, and at worst incorrect research results.

Through the techniques covered in these seminars, not only will the code produced be more reliable, but development will actually be easier and faster for the experts.

**Get a tailored course that will meet the specific needs of your company.**

The course consists of 5 seminars where I will present the key ideas and techniques, as well as allowing plenty of time for in depth questions afterwards.

The seminars themselves can be tailored to the specific needs of your company. I am also available following the seminars to have group or one-on-one meetings to discuss the specific software engineering challenges you face, and work with you to come up with a solution that works for everyone.

You can read more about what the course covers and how it is structured [here](#the-course).

## The Course

The course is designed to cover the key areas of modern software engineering best practises. Each seminar will help developers to adopt industry standard approaches to developing software. These cover both technical topics such as writing automated tests, as well as procedural topics such as en effective code review process.

You may already be using some of these techniques, so the course is entirely customisable to exclude the parts you already do, or provide more details on what is mission critical to you.

**Get in touch today to craft a bespoke course for your business.**

The full course consists of 5 seminars:

 1. [Source Control](#source-control)
 2. [Automated Tests](#automated-tests)
 3. [“Good” Code](#good-code)
 4. [Code Review](#code-review)
 5. [Continuous Integration (CI)](#continuous-integration-ci)

 Each of the seminars features practical examples using Python, [Git](https://git-scm.com/), Gitlab. During the seminars I answer questions, including giving plenty of time for the specific challenges you are having using these best practises. I also like to foster an on-going relationship after you have completed the course to help you put these tools and techniques into practice.

### Source Control

Source control is a tool that stores your source code, and tracks changes the developers make to to that code across time. It facilitates collaboration between multiple developers working on the same code, as well as ensuring reproducible results.

If you are not already using source control, this seminar will teach you how to get set up, and how to use it effectively.

**Source control is vital for working with other developers on code. It allows for fast iteration, whilst maintaining stability of the software. Learning to use source control will revolutionise your software development process.**

If you already use source control, well done! This seminar can be tailored to whatever tools you use and to cover best practises for using them effectively. Get in touch today to discuss how to make this seminar be useful for your company.

#### Topics & Technologies

The off-the-shelf seminar will cover:

* Why you should use source control
* How to setup a new [Git](https://git-scm.com/) repository (Git is the most popular source control software in industry).
* How to host your new repository on [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) - a widely used cloud tool for storing source code and more
* Basic operations of git, using the command line and [Git-Cola](https://git-cola.github.io/) - a user friendly tool for interacting with Git
* How to use the "Github workflow" to enhance collaboration

This seminar can be tweaked to use different source control software, hosting options to match your existing workflows.  Please get in touch with me and we can customise this talk to meet your needs and match your skills.

### Automated Tests

Automated tests are one of the most powerful tools in a developers toolkit. By writing little bits of code that test specific portions of your piece of software, you free yourself up from having to constantly re-test your changes by hand. It also improves the overall reliability of the software when you have multiple people working on the same project.

This seminar will explain all the ways in which automated tests are indispensable. It will cover how to write tests, even when the code is complicated, with plenty of Python examples.

**In my experience I have seen that code that isn't tested does not work as the writer intends. Learning to write tests will help your software development process be more correct in the long term, and faster in the short term.**

#### Technologies

The off-the-shelf seminar will use:

 * [Python](https://www.python.org/) - a popular programming language
 * [Python unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) - the built-in unit testing framework in Python
 * [Python unittest.mock](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.mock.html) - the built-in mocking framework in Python

This seminar can be tweaked to use the language of your choice, or cover testing examples that resemble the kind of code you write to make this easier to apply. Get in touch today to start writing automated tests today.

### "Good" Code

Writing code is relatively easy, but writing "good" code is elusive. My experience has taught me that good code is code that is:

1. Readable
2. Testable
3. Maintainable

This seminar will justify why writing good code is important, before providing a large toolkit of guidelines and techniques that can be applied to your code to make it more readable, testable and maintainable.

**Code is a communication tool, writing good code will minimize misunderstanding between past and future developers.**

This seminar can be adjusted by reviewing some of your existing code to see the kind of problems that your experiencing and focusing on the techniques that will apply to your code base. Get in touch today to start learning how to write better code.

#### Technologies

The examples will be in Python, but the techniques can be applied to any programming language.

### Code Review

A code review process involves having one developer review another developers changes to the source code before it is submitted. It is a key step to ensuring that code is readable and tested. It also serves to reduce the "bus factor" of the project. It also upskills developers on code writing techniques for free.

This seminar will cover all the advantages of a code review process. It will explain how to practically implement one, using Gitlab's code review tools. Finally it will cover how to review code efficiently, maximising the benefit for the time spent.

**Having a code review process will simultaneously upskill your developers and improve the quality of your code.**

Get in touch today to learn about how code review can help your software development practises. This seminar can be customised to include reviewing someones code as part of a demonstration.

#### Technologies

* [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/) - a widely used cloud tool for conducting code reviews

As with all the other seminars, get in touch if you use a different platform for conducting code reviews and I can tailor the course to use that website to make it easier to apply this to your existing workflows.


### Continuous Integration (CI)

Using Continuous Integration technologies like Gitlab Actions or CircleCI is a very cheap and easy way to increase the reliability of your software. In conjunction with source control and automated tests, every change to the code is checked to actually do what it is supposed to do. This frees developers up from testing changes by hand and to focus on their important work.

This seminar will cover setting up a basic continuous integration system using Gitlab Actions. It will also cover what a good CI should be doing.

**Continuous Integration allows developers to make changes confidently and efficiently.**

#### Technologies

 * [Gitlab CI/CD](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/) - a popular cloud platform for running a CI system on

This seminar can be adjusted to use examples from your preferred technologies. After the course I'd be happy to help with troubleshooting any problems that arise.

## Pricing

Each of the seminars cost £1200 to deliver. An on-going consulting after the seminars is £600 per day, or £100 per hour.

I am deeply passionate about helping domain experts become better software engineers. If this pricing structure doesn't work for you, or you want to tailor the course to your business needs then please get in touch and we can discuss a pricing structure that works for you.
